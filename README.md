# Discord-RPC
the python program I use for my custom discord status

# Requirements:
- python3
- pypresence (run pip install pypresence if you don't already have it installed)

# Install:
- run git clone https://github.com/ApplePi313/Discord-RPC.git
- to run, either execute run.sh(linux only) or run python sys_monitor.py
- (linux only) if you want this to run on start, set run.sh to be run on start (for kde, this is System Settings > Startup and Shutdown > Autostart)
- run.sh is for linux only because I don't use windows and am not bothered to figure out how to set that up
